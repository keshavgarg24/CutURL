# CutURL
The URL shortening currently works fine in local enevironemnt but there is some issues after deployment with the weird rendering patterns of vercel for the projects not made using next, LOL 

It had cuturl.tech as its official domain but i have taken that down for now and https://cut-url.vercel.app this domain just shows the frontend and does not actually perfroms the shortening functionality but i am sharing below a video and pictures of how it shows the statictics for your link , how it analyse and track it
